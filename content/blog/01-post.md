The Rfun series welcomes you back to the Duke University campus and we invite you to join us for an informative semester of workshops about R using RStudio and the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).  These workshops will provide you with a gentle hands-on introduction to a most powerful data science toolkit.  Attend one or attend them all. 

The cost is free and registration is for in-person attendance only.  **Fortunately** the resources are shareable.  You can find links to previous workshop resources (code, video, github) on this very website:  https://rfun.library.duke.edu

## Workshop Arrangement

This workshop series is intended to be iterative and recursive.  We recommend starting with the *Introduction to R*.  Proceed through the remaining workshops as you are interested.  Be aware each workshop may rely on or develop concepts presented earlier.  

## Recordings and Past Workshops
We presented a similar version of this workshop series last spring and recorded those sessions whenever possible.  Past workshop resource links are shareable and presented in a listicle format:  [Rfun recap](/2018/05/15/winter-spring-2018-r-workshops-summary-review/).
